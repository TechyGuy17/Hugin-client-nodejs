# Hugin Node.JS Client
This is a basic hugin messenger client written in Node.JS using our newly published POST in hugin API

# USAGE
Go through the client.js file and do the following:
1) Add your address + the private key of said address
2) Add the address of a updated hugin API, for example the official one (https://api.hugin.chat)

After that run the following:
```npm i``` followed by ```node client.js``` and you should be up and running!
